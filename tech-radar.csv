Scala,adopt,Languages,FALSE,"<p>We keep receiving positive feedback on ""post-Selenium"" web UI testing tools such as <strong><a href=""http://www.cypress.io/"">Cypress</a></strong>, <a href=""/radar/tools/testcafe"">TestCafe</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/puppeteer"">Puppeteer</a>. Running end-to-end tests can present challenges, such as the long duration of the running process, the flakiness of some tests and the challenges of fixing failures in CI when running tests in headless mode. Our teams have had very good experiences with Cypress by solving common issues such as lack of performance and long wait time for responses and resources to load. Cypress has become the tool of choice for end-to-end testing within our teams.</p>"
Java,adopt,Languages,FALSE,"<p>Over the past couple of years, we've noticed a steady rise in the popularity of analytics notebooks. These are Mathematica-inspired applications that combine text, visualization and code in a living, computational document. <strong><a href=""http://jupyter.org/"">Jupyter</a></strong> Notebooks are widely used by our teams for prototyping and exploration in analytics and machine learning. We've moved Jupyter to Adopt for this issue of the Radar to reflect that it has emerged as the current default for Python notebooks. However, we caution to use <a href=""/radar/techniques/productionizing-jupyter-notebooks"">Jupyter Notebooks in production</a>.</p>"
Python,trial,Languages,TRUE,"<p>One of the challenges of using cloud services is being able to develop and test locally. <strong><a href=""https://github.com/localstack/localstack"">LocalStack</a></strong> solves this problem for <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws"">AWS</a> by providing local <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html"">test double</a> implementations of a wide range of AWS services, including S3, Kinesis, DynamoDB and Lambda. It builds on top of best-of-breed tools such as <a href=""https://github.com/mhart/kinesalite"">Kinesalite</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/mhart/dynalite"">dynalite</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/spulec/moto"">Moto</a> and adds isolated processes and error injection functionality. LocalStack is very easy to use, ships with a simple JUnit runner and a JUnit 5 extension and can also run inside a docker container. For many teams, it has become the default for testing services that are deployed on AWS.</p>"
Typescript,assess,Languages,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.terraform.io/"">Terraform</a></strong>, is rapidly becoming a de facto choice for creating and managing cloud infrastructures by writing declarative definitions. The configuration of the servers instantiated by Terraform is usually left to Puppet, Chef or Ansible. We like Terraform because the syntax of its files is quite readable and because it supports a number of cloud providers while making no attempt to provide an artificial abstraction across those providers. The active community will add support for the latest features from most cloud providers. Following our first, more cautious, mention of Terraform almost two years ago, it has seen continued development and has evolved into a stable product with a good ecosystem that has proven its value in our projects. The issue with state file management can now be sidestepped by using what Terraform calls a ""remote state backend."" We've successfully used <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/s3/"">AWS S3</a> for that purpose.</p>"
Spark,adopt,Languages,FALSE,"<p>As more and more teams embrace <a href=""/radar/techniques/designops"">DesignOps</a>, practices and tooling in this space mature. <strong>UI dev environments</strong> provide a comprehensive environment for quickly iterating on UI components, focusing on collaboration between user experience designers and developers. We now have a few options in this space: <a href=""https://storybook.js.org/"">Storybook</a>, <a href=""https://react-styleguidist.js.org/"">React Styleguidist</a>, <a href=""https://compositor.io/"">Compositor</a> and <a href=""https://mdxjs.com/"">MDX</a>. You can use these tools standalone in component library or design system development as well as embedded in a web application project. Many teams were able to decrease their UI feedback cycles and improve timing of UI work in preparation for development work, which has made using UI dev environments a reasonable default for us.</p>"
Maven,adopt,Tools,FALSE,"<p>As developers used to pushing many small commits daily, we rely on monitors to notify us when builds go green. <strong><a href=""https://www.anystat.us/"">AnyStatus</a></strong> is a lightweight Windows desktop app that rolls up metrics and events from various sources into one place. Examples include build results and releases, health checks for different services and OS metrics. Think of it as CCTray on steroids. It's also available as a Visual Studio plugin.</p>"
Docker,adopt,Tools,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/avajs/ava"">AVA</a></strong> is a test runner for Node.js. Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, IO in Node.js can happen in parallel because of its asynchronous nature. AVA takes advantage of this and runs your tests concurrently, which is especially beneficial for IO-heavy tests. In addition, test files are run in parallel as separate processes, giving you even better performance and an isolated environment for each test file. AVA is a lightweight option, when compared to full-featured frameworks such as <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/jest"">Jest</a>. It is opinionated and forces you to write atomic test cases.</p>"
Ansible,adopt,Tools,FALSE,"<p>So much energy and effort continue to be wasted on configuring local development environments and troubleshooting the ""works on my machine"" problem. For many years our teams have adopted the <a href=""https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i"">""check out and go""</a> approach where we use a scripted approach to ensure the local development environment is configured consistently. <strong><a href=""https://github.com/charleskorn/batect/"">batect</a></strong> is an open source tool developed by a ThoughtWorker that makes it easy to set up and share a build environment based on <a href=""/radar/techniques/docker-for-builds"">Docker</a>. batect becomes the entry point script for your build system, launching containers to perform build tasks that don't rely at all on local setup. Changes to build configuration and dependencies are simply shared through source control without requiring any changes or installations on local machines or CI agents. While we like <a href=""/radar/tools/cage"">Cage</a>, among other tools, in this space, we see batect quickly growing in favor with our teams.</p>"
Bazel,assess,Tools,TRUE,"<p>One of the challenges of search is ensuring the most relevant results for the user appear at the top of the list. This is where learning to rank (LTR) can help. LTR is the process of applying machine learning to rank documents retrieved by a search engine. If you're using <a href=""/radar/platforms/elastic-search"">Elasticsearch</a>, you can achieve search-relevant ranking with the <a href=""https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank""><strong>Elasticsearch LTR</strong></a> plugin. The plugin uses <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/RankLib/"">RankLib</a> for generating the models during the training phase. Then, when querying Elasticsearch, you can use this plugin to ""rescore"" the top results. We've used it in a few projects and have been happy with the results. There's also an equivalent <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/7_7/learning-to-rank.html"">LTR solution</a> for Solr users.</p>"
Helm,trial,Tools,TRUE,"<p><a href=""http://helm.sh""><strong>Helm</strong></a> is a package manager for <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. It comes with a repository of curated Kubernetes applications that are maintained in the official <a href=""https://github.com/helm/charts"">Charts repository</a>. Helm has two components: a command line utility called Helm and a cluster component called Tiller. Securing a Kubernetes cluster is a wide and nuanced topic, but we highly recommend setting up Tiller in a role-based access control (RBAC) environment. We've used Helm in a number of client projects and its dependency management, templating and hook mechanism has greatly simplified the application lifecycle management in Kubernetes. However, we recommend proceeding with caution — Helm's <a href=""/radar/techniques/templating-in-yaml"">YAML templating</a> can be difficult to understand, and Tiller still has some rough edges. Helm 3 is expected to address these issues.</p>"
Jenkins,adobt,Tools,TRUE,"<p>How does an organization give autonomy to delivery teams while still making sure their deployed solutions are safe and compliant? How do you ensure that servers, once deployed, maintain a consistent configuration without drift? <strong><a href=""https://www.chef.io/inspec/"">InSpec</a></strong> is positioned as a solution for continuous compliance and security, but you can also use it for general infrastructure testing. InSpec allows the creation of declarative infrastructure tests, which can then be continuously run against provisioned environments including production. Our teams particularly praise its extensible design with resources and matchers for multiple platforms. We recommend trialling InSpec as a solution to the problem of assuring compliance and security.</p>"
OpenShift,adopt,Platforms,TRUE,"<p>Good UI animation could greatly improve user experience. However, to reproduce a designer's delicate animation on an app is usually a challenging task for developers. <strong><a href=""http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/"">Lottie</a></strong> is a library for Android, iOS, web, and Windows that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON with Bodymovin and renders them natively on mobile and on the web. Both designers and developers can continue to use their familiar tools and have a fluent collaboration.</p>"
Yarn,adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>Setting up highly available PostgreSQL instances can be tricky, which is why we like <a href=""/radar/tools/patroni"">Patroni</a> — it helps us speed up the setup of PostgreSQL clusters. <a href=""https://github.com/sorintlab/stolon""><strong>Stolon</strong></a> is another tool that we've used successfully to run high-availability (HA) clusters of PostgreSQL instances in production using Kubernetes. Although PostgreSQL supports streaming replication out of the box, the challenge in an HA setup is to assure that the clients always connect to the current master. We like that Stolon enforces the connection to the right PostgreSQL master by actively closing connections to unelected masters and routing requests to the active one.</p>"
MapR,adopt,Infrastracture,TRUE,"<p>We have good experience using ""post-Selenium"" web UI testing tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/cypress"">Cypress</a>, <strong><a href=""https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe"">TestCafe</a></strong> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/puppeteer"">Puppeteer</a>. TestCafe lets you write tests in JavaScript or <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a> and runs in-browser tests. TestCafe has several useful features that include out-of-the-box parallel execution and HTTP request mocking. TestCafe uses an asynchronous execution model with no explicit wait times, which results in much more stable test suites. Its selector API makes it easier to implement <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html"">PageObject</a> patterns. TestCafe recently released version 1.0.<em>x</em>, which improved stability and functionality.</p>"
